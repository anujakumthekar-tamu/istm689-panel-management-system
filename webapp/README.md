## Initial Setup

For the initial setup we need to have installed `nodejs v18.17.1`. Then we can install all the package dependecies running `npm install` in the `webapp` directory. Ready to start the project!

## Scripts

To interact with the project you need to run. 

### Start local development enviroment
Run `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Build production files
**Note:** We not need to build the production files because it is handled by Amplify.\
Run: `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
